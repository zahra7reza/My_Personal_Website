    <p>Words can't express the joy and love I have for video games, the escapism, music, dialogue and interactions within the characters and enviroment .
       The great thing about video games is that it brings people together, it's great for self-confidence espically in children, improving maths and english and improves hand-eye co-ordination as well as fine motor skills.
       For me though, it's always been the story line and interactions that's gripped me through out my years playing and whcih has lead me to study this amazing subject. 
       You don't release how much hard work goes into creating a game until you research it or study a course in it, and this is what I really appreciate about this art form whether a 2D game or 3D game or whether the game has been made by Indie companies or commercial companies.</p>
    
    <p>The 3 games I am playing at the moment are  the Hitman Series, Skyrim, and eFootball PES 2020. </p>
